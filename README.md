This is a prototype of a miner for solving XEL work packages.  **The miner is not optimized in any way** as its purpose is to demonstrate all the functionality of ElasticPL and the workflow between the Miner & Elastic Node regardless of hardware or OS.

It is intended that other developers will improve upon the miner performance & functionality by creating versions for specific hardware / OS including all applicable optimizations.

**The GPU miner is highly experimental.  If you choose to use it, monitor your cards closely to ensure they don't overheat.**

----
## Run XEL Miner from sources

Miner		v0.9.6
ElasticPL 	v0.9.1

**The miner build has been tested using GCC on Ubuntu 16.04 as well as MinGW32 (using GCC) on Windows 7/10.**

### install pre-requisities

##### Linux

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libudev-dev screen libtool pkg-config libjansson-dev libssl-dev
```

##### macOS

you must first install homebrew (if not already installed):

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then proceed with the installation :

```
brew install gmp make cmake openssl
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/include/openssl /usr/local/include/openssl
```

### build

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/xel-software/xel-miner
cd xel-miner
```

if you **don't** want to use OpenCL :
```
cmake .
make install
```

if you want to use OpenCL :
```
cmake .  -USE_OPENCL
make install
```


### run

##### using CPU:

`./xel_miner -t <num_threads> -P "<secret_phrase>" -D`

if you want to use it with a remote node, add the option `-o <remote node>` :

`./xel_miner -t <num_threads> -P "<secret_phrase>" -D -o http://computation-01.xel.org:17876`

##### using GPU:

`./xel_miner -t <num_threads> -P "<secret_phrase>" -D --opencl`

use `./xel_miner -h` to see a full list of options.
